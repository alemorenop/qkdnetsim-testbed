/**

 * Linux pfifo_fast is the default priority queue enabled on Linux
 * systems. Packets are enqueued in three FIFO droptail queues according
 * to three priority bands based on the packet priority.
 *
 * The system behaves similar to three ns3::DropTail queues operating
 * together, in which packets from higher priority bands are always
 * dequeued before a packet from a lower priority band is dequeued.
 *
 * The queue disc capacity, i.e., the maximum number of packets that can
 * be enqueued in the queue disc, is set through the limit attribute, which
 * plays the same role as txqueuelen in Linux. If no internal queue is
 * provided, three DropTail queues having each a capacity equal to limit are
 * created by default. User is allowed to provide queues, but they must be
 * three, operate in packet mode and each have a capacity not less
 * than limit.
 *
 * @note Additional waiting queues are installed between the L3
 * and  ISO/OSI layer to avoid conflicts in decision making
 * which could lead to inaccurate routing. Experimental testing and usage!
